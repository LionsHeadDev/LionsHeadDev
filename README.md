# Hi, Iâ€™m Omar MehmoodðŸ‘‹

I like building things that actually work and teaching myself along the way like an open book. 
Right now, Iâ€™m focused on becoming a strong **software developer**, and my long-term goal is to move into **quantum development**.

---

## What Iâ€™m Working On
- **[Verba](https://github.com/LionsHeadDev/verba)** â€” a French learning app built in React + Vite.  
  Instead of flashcards with ads and gimmicks, it teaches like a large interactive book: greetings, grammar, slang, and quizzes.  
- Small supporting projects to practice React, Django REST, and PostgreSQL.

---

## What I Use
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, CSS  
- **Backend:** Django REST (learning), Node basics  
- **Databases:** SQLite, PostgreSQL  
- **Tools:** Git/GitHub, VS Code  

---

## Why Iâ€™m Here
GitHub is my learning log. Every project here is me practicing how to take an idea, build it from scratch, and ship it off to browsers, desktops, and hopefully one day to mobile devices like iPhone or Android.  

---

## The Big Picture
- Right now â†’ learning by building and finishing projects.  
- Next â†’ internships and real-world experience as a software engineer.  
- Future â†’ dive into **quantum computing** and help shape what comes next in the future of computing.
