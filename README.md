# Hey, Iâ€™m Omar ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student who loves building things with code.  
Right now my main goal is to become a **software engineer** â€” someone who can design and ship full applications from start to finish.

## What Iâ€™m working on
- **Verba** â†’ a French learning app Iâ€™m building with React + Vite.  
   - My idea is to make it work everywhere: in a browser, on desktop, and even on mobile.  
- Learning fullstack skills with **React** on the front and **Django REST** on the back.  
- On the side I like making small games in **Unreal Engine** and messing around with Blender.

## Skills Iâ€™m picking up
- Frontend â†’ React, Vite, CSS  
- Backend â†’ Django REST, Node basics  
- Databases â†’ SQLite, Postgres  
- Tools â†’ Git/GitHub, VS Code, Unreal Engine

## A bit about me
I enjoy combining creativity with code.  
Sometimes that means building a study app, other times it means making a weird little game.  
Either way, Iâ€™m always learning and trying to get better.
